    <h2>Background: Quench Water Dispenser</h2>

    <p>
      The Data Science Initiative (DSI) at Brown University previously used a
      water dispenser that lacked durability and was prone to leakage. To
      address these issues, the staff replaced it with a new Quench water
      dispenser, designed to be more reliable and touch-free for improved
      hygiene and ease of use. The Quench dispenser offers four water
      optionsâ€”cold, ambient, sparkling, and hot. Instead of physical buttons,
      users hover their hand over sensors to toggle between selections and
      dispense water.

        This interface provides efficient access to clean drinking water with
        multiple options (cold, sparkling, ambient, and hot). TheÂ touch-free
        hover controlsÂ reduce the spread of germs, while theÂ mode
        selectorÂ provides flexibility for different water preferences.
        However, some users struggle with the lack of pressable buttons, as
        the hover-based controls are not immediately intuitive and may confuse
        first-time users.

      While this upgrade aimed to enhance functionality and hygiene, our study
      reveals that it may have introduced usability challenges for beginner
      and rushed users. This project examines how people interact with the new
      interface though interviews, personas, and a storymap documenting user
      experiences.

  <!-- ðŸŸ¢ Interview Section -->
  <section id="interviews">
    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>
      We conducted interviews with several participants (more than three) to
      understand their experiences with the Quench water dispenser. Here are
      some key insights that capture the general patterns we noticed:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Approach:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users began by placing their bottle on the tray, most did so
            without even pausing to read instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some took a few seconds to read the instructions and scan the
            available options (<strong>cold, sparkling, ambient, hot</strong>)
            before proceeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users with people waiting behind them tended to act more quickly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Mode Selection:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Most users did not need to change the setting, as
            <strong>cold water</strong> was most popular and set as default.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some users hovered their <strong>front hand</strong> over the mode
            selector to toggle between the options, while others used their
            <strong>back hand</strong>. Some even unnecessarily touched the
            button directly, which would sometimes not trigger any interface
            response depending on the location touched and would often require
            multiple attempts.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Dispensing Process:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Similar to the mode selector, users interacted with the dispensing
            button in various ways. Some hovered their
            <strong>front hand</strong>, others used their
            <strong>back hand</strong>, and some directly touched it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some users actively watched the water as it filled their bottle,
            while others checked their phone while waiting, occasionally
            glancing at the bottle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some users misaligned their bottle at first and adjusted it so
            water stopped hitting the tray.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Exit Behavior:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some users lingered briefly to wipe the spout before leaving.
          </li>
          <li>
            Others left immediately after collecting their water, without any
            additional interaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We also asked each of our subjects questions to better understand their
      experiences with the Quench water dispenser. Here is a summary of the
      responses we recieved:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>How often do you use this dispenser? Why did you choose this one over another option?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Frequent users (e.g., three times a day) relied on it for convenience, especially those who worked or
            studied nearby. They appreciated that it was <strong>free and easily accessible</strong>.</li>
          <li>Occasional users (e.g., once a week) and new users used it when visiting the DSI or simply when they got
            thirsty.</li>
          <li>Some preferred it over other options for its <strong>faster dispensing</strong> and additional water
            settings (<strong>sparkling, ambient, hot</strong>).</li>
          <li>A few previously used the adjacent filtered water station but switched to this dispenser for its
            <strong>faster flow and cold water option</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Others valued the <strong>touch-free hover feature</strong>, considering it <strong>more hygienic</strong>
            than physical button dispensers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>What features did you expect to see on the interface before using it?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Most users expected basic water options like <strong>cold and hot</strong>.</li>
          <li>Some were surprised to find a <strong>sparkling water and ambient water</strong> option.</li>
          <li>Others expected <strong>clearer, step-by-step instructions</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>How easy or difficult was it to navigate the interface? What made it that way?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Frequent users found the interface <strong>easy and intuitive</strong>, likely because they had learned
            the hover-based interaction over time.</li>
          <li>New users struggled with <strong>switching modes</strong> (e.g., from cold to ambient) due to the lack of
            <strong>clear instructions</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Many assumed the mode selector and dispense buttons were <strong>meant to be pressed</strong>, leading to
            confusion when pressing didnâ€™t work.</li>
          <li>Some found the buttons <strong>unresponsive at times</strong>, requiring multiple hovers for selection.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Was there a specific water setting you were looking for, and if so, how easy was it to find and
          select?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Most users wanted <strong>cold water</strong>, the default setting, making it easy to access.</li>
          <li>Those preferring <strong>sparkling or ambient water</strong> took a few extra seconds to locate and switch
            settings.</li>
          <li>Users who preferred <strong>hot water</strong> found the hover-based toggling
            <strong>inefficient</strong>, as it required multiple steps (<strong>cold â†’ sparkling â†’ ambient â†’
              hot</strong>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Have you used a different water dispenser before? How does this one compare?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Most users had used dispensers with <strong>pressable buttons or levers</strong> rather than hover-based
            controls.</li>
          <li>Some found this dispenser <strong>more modern and hygienic</strong> but <strong>less intuitive</strong>
            for first-time users.</li>
          <li>Several users found mode selection <strong>cumbersome</strong>, preferring dispensers where settings could
            be <strong>selected directly</strong> rather than toggled.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Did the dispenser meet your expectations for speed, ease of use, and hygiene? Why or why not?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Most users found it <strong>fast and convenient</strong>, as long as they knew how to switch modes.</li>
          <li>Some liked the <strong>touch-free hover feature</strong> for hygiene.</li>
          <li>Others felt the interface could be <strong>clearer</strong> to reduce initial confusion.</li>
          <li>A few expressed <strong>hygiene concerns</strong>, with some wiping the spout before use.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>If you could change one thing about the interface, what would it be?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Some suggested making the buttons <strong>more responsive with less delay</strong>.</li>
          <li>A few recommended <strong>clearer labels</strong> (e.g., explicitly stating "hover") and a <strong>more
              noticeable instruction panel</strong>.</li>
          <li>Some preferred <strong>pressable buttons</strong> to make mode selection <strong>more efficient</strong>,
            allowing them to pick a setting in <strong>one step</strong> rather than toggling through multiple options.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
    <p>
      Based on our "Confused Cameron" persona, we created a storyboard mapping
      out his entire user journey with the Quench water dispenser from start
      to end. Note that during Cameron's struggle, he fails to realize that
      the dispenser uses touch-free hover controls, leading to confusion and
      frustration as he tries to figure out how to toggle between modes.

  <!-- ðŸŸ¢ Reflection Section -->
  <section id="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      In our study of the Quench water dispenser interface, we found that
      while the touch-free hover controls provide a sleek, modern, and
      hygienic upgrade over traditional button-operated dispensers, they
      arenâ€™t always easy to figure out for everyone. Using empathy mapping and
      storyboarding, we noticed that first-time users, like "Confused
      Cameron," often get tripped up by the lack of clear instructions. This
      leads to accidentally switching modes or struggling to dispense water
      correctly. On the other hand, frequent users, like "Holly Hustle," have
      no trouble navigating the interface but feel the multi-step toggling
      process is clunky and time-consuming, especially when theyâ€™re in a
      hurry. To make the experience better for everyone, we suggest adding
      direct mode selections, clearer hover cues, and more responsive
      controls. These changes could go a long way in improving usability and
      satisfaction.
